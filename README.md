### Hello!

I'm Doug and I like to experiment with hardware and software.
There are dozens of tiny projects that I made for fun once and don't maintain at all.

Some other places you can find my work on the internet:

* Blog [https://64zbit.com](https://64zbit.com)
* Twitter [https://twitter.com/64zbit](https://twitter.com/64zbit)
